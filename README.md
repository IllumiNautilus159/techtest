# Body slam

Body slam is a simple, lightweight, and blazingly fast web framework for Rust. Jokes.

It's a technical interview template.

## What is this app?

This app takes some source data about moves Snorlax can learn and displays it in a table. The data is stored in a JSON file.

## What's the problem?

We want to make the moves in the table clickable, taking you to have a page dedicated to each move.
